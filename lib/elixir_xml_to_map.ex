  naive_map(xml) utility is inspired by Rails Hash.from_xml()
  but is "naive" in that it is convenient (requires no setup)
  but carries the same drawbacks. Use with caution.

  XML and Maps are non-isomorphic.
  Attributes on some nodes don't carry over if the node has just
  one text value (like a leaf). Naive map has no validation over
   what should be a collection.  If and only if nodes are repeated
    at the same level will they beome a list.
